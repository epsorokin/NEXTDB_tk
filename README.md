NEXTDB_tk
========

This is a utility for downloading batches of images from an online database, based on ensembl gene identifier. Works well with the C. elegans NEXTDB database (http://nematode.lab.nig.ac.jp/db2/KeysrchForm.php) and in future will be paired with other image-based database queries. 

`Usage: python grab_insitu_images.py`

Follow the interactive prompt to select a TXT file containing a single column of genes or transcripts of interest.
